![Banner](https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?crime,investigation)

## 🚀 Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict femicide cases in Indonesia using a dataset compiled from verified news articles and social media reports. The dataset covers cases from September 2023 to September 2024 and predicts trends from August 2024 to August 2025.

## 🔥 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Prediction modeling for future cases
- Visualization of trends and insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Google Colab** (Cloud-based coding environment)
- **Machine Learning** for forecasting

## 💻 Installation & Usage
### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/femicide-forecast.git
cd femicide-forecast
```

### 2. Open in Google Colab
- Upload the Jupyter Notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Run the cells sequentially to analyze and predict

### 3. Install required libraries
```python
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `No` - Case number
- `Kota` - City where the case occurred
- `Umur` - Age of the victim
- `Bln/Tahun` - Month/Year of the incident
- `Alasan Pembunuh 1 & 2` - Motives behind the crime
- `Pembunuh Oleh` - Perpetrator type
- `Cara Membunuh` - Method used
- `Nasib Pembunuh` - Fate of the perpetrator

## 🔮 Prediction Model
The model uses **time series forecasting** to predict the number of femicide cases in the future based on past trends. Techniques include:
- ARIMA/SARIMA
- Machine Learning Regression Models

## 📈 Results & Findings
Key insights from the analysis will be updated here as the project progresses.
